# logcaty
The script provided is a shell script that uses the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to capture logs from an Android device or emulator using Logcat. It sets up variables for filtering and log file name, clears any existing Logcat buffers, and starts Logcat with filtering and redirection options.
Sets up two variables at the top of the script, APP_PACKAGE_NAME and LOG_FILENAME, to specify the package name of the app to filter on and the name of the log file to create.
Uses the adb logcat -c command to clear any existing logcat buffers before starting.
Starts logcat with the -v time option to include a timestamp in each log entry, and the -s option to filter the output to only show logs from the specified app package name. The output of Logcat is redirected to a file.
Uses the sort command to sort the log entries in the log file by different parameters. The -t ' ' option specifies the delimiter between fields, and the -k option specifies the fields to use for sorting. In this example, the log entries are sorted by timestamp, message priority, message tag, and message content.
You can customize this script to sort the log entries by other parameters as well, depending on your needs. For example, you can sort by process ID, thread ID, or other fields that are included in the log entries.
